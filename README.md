# Flavor Bombs Overview

## App Description: 
The Flavor Bombs project aims to create a food service app that connects customers and restaurants. Customers will be able to view restaurants in their vicinity and see reviews to decide which restaurant they would like to order from. Customers will also be able to view menus from specific restaurants and see their location in a map to help the customer decide where to order from. Additionally, the app will store the customer's order history. Admins will have access to their own dashboard which will allow them to view, update and delete customer info as well as orders.
